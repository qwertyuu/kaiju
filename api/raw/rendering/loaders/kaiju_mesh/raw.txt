TYPES

type KaijuMesh struct {
	Name    string
	Verts   []rendering.Vertex
	Indexes []uint32
}
    KaijuMesh is a base primitive representing a single mesh. This is the
    archived format of the authored meshes. Typically this structure is created
    by loading in a mesh using something like [loaders.GLTF] and then converting
    the result of that using LoadedResultToKaijuMesh. From this point, it is
    typically serialized and stored into the content database. When reading a
    mesh from the content database, it will return a KaijuMesh.

func Deserialize(data []byte) (KaijuMesh, error)
    Deserialize will construct a KaijuMesh from the given array of bytes.
    This deserialization uses the built-in gob.Decoder

func LoadedResultToKaijuMesh(res load_result.Result) []KaijuMesh
    LoadedResultToKaijuMesh will take in a load_result.Result and convert
    every mesh contained within the structure to our built in version known as
    KaijuMesh. This is typically used for the editor, but games/applications may
    find some use for it.

func (k KaijuMesh) GenerateBVH(threads *concurrent.Threads, transform *matrix.Transform, data any) *collision.BVH

func (k KaijuMesh) Serialize() ([]byte, error)
    Serialize will convert a KaijuMesh into a byte array for saving to the
    database or later use. This serialization uses the built-in gob.Encoder
